# Professional-Portfolio

## Description

My goal in building this portfolio application was to create an online resume of sorts and give some background information on myself. As well as showcasing some of the ever-growing skills that I am developing during this web developement course and ongoing career. Building this project also taught me some additional skills in CSS as I ran into a few different obstacles upon designing the layout of this webpage. This finished project will also allow me to show some tangible information to potential employers and not have to rely so much on in person physical resumes.
