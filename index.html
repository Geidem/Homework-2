            <p>Born in Northern Utah into a military family, I was quickly relocated to Oceanside California and then Colorado Springs, Colorado. Ultimately ending up back in Northern Utah. 
                Attending both grade school, as well as college within the state. I enjoy taking advantage of many things outdoors that Utah has to offer, such as mountain biking, hiking, snowboarding, 
                canyon cruises, whether it be in a car or on a motorcycle. I enjoy all things motorsport. I also train and fight Muay Thai out of a gym in Layton, Utah. Professionally I have been in the auto industry for the past 7-8 years. Originally working at a dealership and eventually branching off and opening my very own small business. </p>
